# Structural readiness checklist for a captain decision filed with structured
# context. Every consumer applies this one definition to the decision's body
# lines, so the filing command, the read-only sweep, and the board cannot drift
# apart. The input to each entry point is the decision body split into lines.
#
# These checks are presence and shape only. Whether the question is clear, the
# recommendation sound, or the linked surface genuinely built stays a judgement
# no script makes; `.agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md` owns it.

# jq has no builtin trim here, and a consumer may define its own; this module
# keeps a private one so the checklist never depends on the caller's program.
