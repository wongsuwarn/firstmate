# fm-captain-commitment.sh - durable follow-through for an explicit captain request.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh open           Record that a captain turn began.
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh defer [<kind>] Mark the open record as left behind.
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh done           Clear the open record; nothing outstanding.
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh track <id>...  Clear it by pointing at backlog work.
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh reconcile      Drop links whose work finished or vanished.
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh pending        Print the bounded informational surface.
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh check          Exit 2 with a reminder while outstanding.
#   fm-captain-commitment.sh --help
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Two real losses: a captain request interrupted by operational work was never
# finished, and a captain request whose blocker had cleared was never resumed.
# Both needed the captain to ask again. This is the smallest durable record that
# makes an unfinished explicit captain request survive a watcher interruption,
# a compaction, and a restart until it has a concrete completion or points at
# tracked work carrying its own next action.
#
# PRIVACY: NO CAPTAIN TEXT IS EVER STORED
#
# The record holds a schema tag, an open timestamp, and a deferred flag. It never
# holds the captain's words, a hash of them, a transcript, or a secret. Content is
# recovered from the visible session, and the surfaced reminder says so plainly
# rather than reading like a reminder that lost its subject.
#
# `tasks-axi` REMAINS THE SOLE OWNER OF ACTUAL WORK
#
# This is not a second work queue. It holds at most one open record plus a set of
# `linked/<task-id>` markers, and every question about what the work is, whether it
# is under way, held, blocked, or finished is answered by reading `tasks-axi`.
#
# LIFECYCLE
#
#   open      Idempotent. A record that already exists is never replaced, so the
#             OLDEST unacknowledged captain turn is the one preserved, and a
#             restart or a repeated session start cannot duplicate it.
#   defer     Marks the open record deferred. With no argument the caller has
#             already established the interruption: session start calls it that
#             way, because a session that ended without dispositioning its record
#             IS the interruption. With an operational kind, only work that
#             genuinely displaces the captain's request counts, so a session-start
#             nudge and this mechanism's own turn-end follow-up are ignored.
#             Anything else displaces, including an unrecognized kind, because
#             failing toward remembering the request is the safe direction.
#   done      Removes the record. A request finished in the same response takes
#             this path, so it creates no backlog item and no reminder.
#   track     Refuses unless every named item exists, is not Done, and carries a
#             non-empty body. The body is where the next action and completion
#             criterion live, so an item without one cannot discharge the
#             commitment. On success the record is removed and each id is linked.
#   reconcile Removes a link whose item is Done or absent, so nothing goes stale.
#
# OUTSTANDING PREDICATE (`check`)
#
# Outstanding means an open record marked deferred, or a linked item that is
# dispatchable right now and not under way. A linked item that is in flight, held,
# or blocked is deliberately quiet: a declared external wait is a normal paused
# work item, and demanding progress against it would loop forever.
#
# `check` is also silent while away mode is active. The captain is absent by
# definition, so nothing new can open, and the away-mode return path drains the
# same informational surface through `fm-wake-drain.sh`. `pending` stays visible
# in every mode because it informs rather than blocks.
#
# SCOPE
#
# Every subcommand except `--help` is completely inert outside a genuine primary
# home, using the same `bin/fm-primary-scope-lib.sh` predicate the turn-end guard
# uses, because a crewmate or scout worktree loads the same tracked integration and
# has no captain.
#
# HARNESS BOUNDARY
#
# Every subcommand here is harness-neutral, and the session-start digest and wake
# drain surface `pending` on every primary. Automatic `open`/`defer`/`check` at the
# turn boundary is a per-harness integration; [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](../docs/turnend-guard.md)
# owns which primaries have it and what the others still get.
