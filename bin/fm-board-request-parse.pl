# fm-board-request-parse.pl - the single owner of board message validation.
#
# Usage: fm-board-request-parse.pl <result-file>
#
# Reads one captured process-event result and prints one compact JSON record per
# line. It is the ONE implementation of the board vocabulary and of every
# fail-closed rule, shared by every transport that can carry a board message:
#
#   bin/fm-procevent-board-reply.sh   the direct board reply service
#   bin/fm-procevent-mission-control.sh   the legacy Lavish-bridged surface
#
# Both hand it the same tabular shape, so neither can drift from the other and a
# rule fixed here is fixed for every transport at once. The receiver in
# bin/fm-board-reply-server.py admits a POST by running this same program over
# the exact record line it is about to store, so what is accepted at the door and
# what is validated at wake time are the same bytes through the same rules.
#
# AUTHORITY: none. Every request printed here is captain INTENT for firstmate to
# adjudicate under its own contract, exactly as if the captain had said the same
# words in chat, and never an authorization. This program reads one file and
# prints to stdout; it performs nothing.
#
# TWO DIRECTIONS, one envelope discipline. A `FM-BOARD-REQUEST` envelope is the
# captain speaking to firstmate; a `FM-BOARD-REPLY` envelope is firstmate
# speaking back to the board's Ask-firstmate thread. Both run every rule below,
# but they are separate vocabularies and are emitted as separate kinds, so
# neither direction can be read as the other. A `reply` record is DISPLAY ONLY:
# it is firstmate's own words on their way to a page, never captain intent, and
# nothing ever adjudicates or executes one.
#
# Direction is taken from the marker the prompt STARTS with, and only that
# marker is counted, so text quoting the other direction's marker stays ordinary
# text in both directions.
#
# What it emits, one compact JSON object per line:
#   {"kind":"contract",...}      always first; states that nothing below is authority
#   {"kind":"request",...}       a validated captain request: intent, home, target fields,
#                                  note, structured facts, or a bounded dispatch edit
#   {"kind":"reply",...}         a validated firstmate board reply: intent, note. Display only.
#   {"kind":"message",...}       prose carrying no board marker at all
#   {"kind":"unrecognized",...}  anything else, with a reason. Never acted on.
#
# It is deliberately STATELESS: one result file in, records out. No snapshot, no
# backlog, no network, and no write but stdout. Whether a target still exists is
# firstmate's business at wake time, because a PR may have merged or a task been
# torn down since the board was rendered. There is no fuzzy target matching.
#
# Input shape. Only lines inside the `prompts[<n>]{<columns>}:` block are read,
# and only that block's `prompt` column. Everything before the block and
# everything from the first non-indented line after it are never treated as
# input, so page text, log text, and delta provenance cannot forge a request.
# One record is one physical line with embedded newlines escaped inside a
# JSON-quoted field.
#
# Fail-closed rules, each of which drops a record to "unrecognized" rather than
# guessing: an unknown or missing intent, a wrong version, a field outside its
# allowed set for that intent, an over-long field, an id or home outside the safe
# character set, more than one envelope marker of the leading direction in one
# prompt, an envelope that is not at the start of the prompt, trailing envelope
# content, duplicate object keys, malformed or incomplete structured facts, and
# a record whose quoted field never terminates - which is what a result truncated at
# FM_PROCEVENT_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES looks like. A `defer` carrying note text is
# refused outright, because the hold reason is the captain's own stored text and
# a request must never rewrite it. An intent from the other direction's
# vocabulary is unknown here, so a captain intent posted as a reply and a `say`
# posted at the captain's door are each refused by name.
#
# tests/fm-procevent-mission-control.test.sh pins these rules against bytes
# captured from a real Lavish send; tests/fm-board-reply.test.sh re-proves every
# one of them against the direct service, at its door and at wake time.
