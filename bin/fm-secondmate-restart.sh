# Restart one already-live LOCAL second mate with changed launch flags, keeping
# its persistent home and everything in it.
#
# Usage: fm-secondmate-restart.sh <secondmate-id>
#          [--harness <name>] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>]
#          [--backend <name>] [--remote-control|--rc|--no-remote-control]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   A launch flag can only be changed at launch, and a persistent second mate is
#   never torn down for a flag change: bin/fm-teardown.sh is retirement (it
#   removes the route and the whole home). Before this script the only way to
#   relaunch a live second mate was to retire its endpoint by hand and then run
#   bin/fm-spawn.sh --secondmate. That improvisation is what this replaces: it
#   retires the recorded endpoint through the backend's own API and relaunches
#   the same id in the same home, so the home, backlog, project clones,
#   inherited local material, durable lease, registry route, unresolved routed
#   replies, this second mate's own crewmates, and every piece of unlanded work
#   are untouched.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#   It never returns a treehouse lease, edits data/secondmates.md, touches
#   data/<id>/, state/pending-reply/, the home's own state/ or backlog, or the
#   second mate's crewmate endpoints. It addresses exactly one endpoint - the
#   one recorded in state/<id>.meta - so it never scans for, matches, or closes
#   anything by label or name pattern, and it performs no session-level or
#   workspace-level lifecycle call.
#
# SCOPE
#   Local routes only. A remote second mate is refused up front: its endpoint
#   lives on its configured host, --remote-control is unsupported there
#   (bin/fm-spawn.sh), and an unreachable host is unknown completion rather than
#   a dead endpoint. Reconcile a remote route on its own host.
#
# ENDPOINT RECONCILIATION (the only duplicate-agent guard on this path)
#   A --secondmate spawn skips fm-spawn's presentation block entirely, so it has
#   no existing-metadata duplicate check; the backend's same-label create refusal
#   is the only backstop. This preflight is therefore strict, and it runs under
#   the same state/.spawn-<id>.lock that fm-spawn and the Herdr session cleanup
#   use, so a concurrent spawn or restart of this id cannot interleave with it.
#   The authoritative data/secondmates.md route is validated under its shared
#   registry lock before the endpoint is touched. Both locks are handed directly
#   to fm-spawn and remain held through metadata publication or rollback, so
#   there is no unlocked relaunch gap in which another backend can publish a
#   replacement.
#   The recorded endpoint is validated by fm_backend_validate_task_endpoint and
#   then classified by fm_backend_agent_state:
#     alive    - retire it, then relaunch.
#     dead     - the endpoint exists with no agent; retire the husk, relaunch.
#     missing  - already gone; nothing to retire, relaunch straight away.
#     anything else (ambiguous, unreadable, unverified) - REFUSE, mutating
#                nothing. Zellij lands here because it has no verified recovery
#                classifier, the same reason the session-start liveness sweep
#                skips it; Orca and cmux land here too and additionally cannot
#                hold a second mate endpoint at all. Only tmux and Herdr have
#                the verified classifier this path needs.
#   fm_backend_kill's exit status is never trusted: the Herdr adapter returns 0
#   for a successful close, an unready target, AND a refused unlocked close. The
#   only gate is the post-kill re-read, which must report `missing`. A close that
#   is refused, skipped, or unconfirmed leaves the second mate running and exits
#   non-zero having changed nothing, so a contended lock is a plain rerun.
#
# LAUNCH FLAGS
#   Flags are passed straight through to bin/fm-spawn.sh, which owns their
#   validation. Omitted axes are NOT replayed from the old metadata: harness,
#   model, and effort are re-resolved from config/secondmate-harness on every
#   spawn, which is what makes that pin durable, and replaying a recorded value
#   would defeat it.
#   remote_control is the deliberate exception. It has no config file, so
#   metadata is its only durable record - which is exactly why
#   bin/fm-bootstrap.sh's liveness sweep reads it back when it relaunches a dead
#   second mate. Every other axis survives a relaunch, so this one does too:
#     --remote-control (--rc)  turn it on
#     --no-remote-control      turn it off
#     neither flag             keep whatever state/<id>.meta recorded
#   Both directions are explicit; only an unflagged run inherits. Remote Control
#   stays Claude-local-only and fm-spawn still refuses it for any other harness,
#   every raw launch command, and every remote second mate. This script does not
#   change bin/fm-bootstrap.sh's own retention behavior.
#   Because the harness is re-resolved rather than replayed, an inherited
#   remote_control=1 whose second mate has since been re-pinned to a non-Claude
#   harness makes fm-spawn refuse the relaunch. The refusal names the harness
#   restriction, the previous record is restored as below, and
#   --no-remote-control is the way through.
#
# IF THE RELAUNCH FAILS
#   The endpoint is already gone and cannot be un-killed, so the previous
#   state/<id>.meta snapshot is restored instead. That restored record still
#   carries kind=secondmate and its window=, which is what the next locked
#   session-start liveness sweep needs: it reads the now-gone endpoint as
#   missing and relaunches the second mate automatically, replaying
#   remote_control=1 if the restored record had it. A restart that failed while
#   turning Remote Control ON therefore comes back without it, which is the
#   correct conservative outcome. The error names the retry command so the
#   operator need not wait for the sweep.
#
# On success prints: restarted <id> <spawn success line>
