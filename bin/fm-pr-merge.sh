# Merge a task's PR after recording pr= and any available pr_head= through
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh, so teardown can verify landed work after squash merges.
# The full canonical GitHub PR URL is parsed by bin/fm-pr-lib.sh and the derived
# owner/repository and PR number are passed to gh-axi as separate arguments.
#
# Merge method defaults to --squash when the caller passes none of --squash,
# --merge, --rebase, or --method after the optional -- separator. Extra args
# must not include --repo or -R because the repository comes only from the URL.
# Before merging, bin/fm-evidence-check.sh runs against the actual GitHub PR
# head - gh-axi pr merge lands whatever is currently on the PR branch on
# GitHub, not necessarily the local task worktree's HEAD, so the head is
# resolved the same way bin/fm-review-diff.sh does: a freshly fetched
# refs/pull/<n>/head first, falling back to the pr_head= recorded by
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh, and only then to the local worktree HEAD with a
# warning. The check is scoped to the directories this PR's own commits
# touched (a best-effort diff against the worktree's origin default branch,
# or the local main/master branch when no remote default can be resolved),
# so a pre-existing unrelated leftover pair elsewhere in the repo tree can
# never refuse a merge it has nothing to do with; when no base can be
# determined at all, or a base is found but diffing against it fails (e.g.
# unrelated history with no merge base), the check falls back to scanning
# the whole ref, but when a base is found, the diff succeeds, and every
# changed path is root-level (no directory component to scope to), the
# check is skipped rather than widened back to the whole ref. A
# byte-identical before/after evidence image pair with no
# opt-out marker refuses the merge. bin/fm-evidence-check.sh's own header
# comment owns the pairing convention and opt-out mechanism. If the task's
# recorded worktree is missing or not a git repository, no ref can be
# resolved at all, or the check itself cannot run (e.g. missing python3), a
# loud warning goes to stderr and the merge still proceeds unverified rather
# than failing closed.
# After a successful merge of firstmate's own repo (only), this also fast-
# forwards the primary checkout via bin/fm-ff-lib.sh's primary_self_update -
# see that function's header for the full mechanism and its other trigger.
# Usage: fm-pr-merge.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [-- <extra gh-axi pr merge args>]
