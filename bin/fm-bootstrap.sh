#          When a RUNNING local secondmate worktree is fast-forwarded to
#          firstmate's own current default-branch commit, that update is a
#          purely local fast-forward and never an origin fetch. Remote routes
#          instead converge the persistent home to their configured remote code
#          root. If either placement changes its loaded instruction surface
#          (AGENTS.md, bin/, or .agents/skills/), bootstrap immediately nudges it
#          via FM_HOME=<active-home> bin/fm-send.sh fm-<id> so meta resolves the
#          current route and the standard from-firstmate marker is applied. A
#          successful send prints one BOOTSTRAP_INFO line with the exact target
#          and message sent; a failed send leaves an idempotent retry marker
#          under state/.secondmate-nudge-pending/ and prints an actionable
#          NUDGE_SECONDMATES line.
#          Already-current or no-instruction-change homes are silently left alone.
#          The secondmate sweep also propagates declared inherited local material
#          into each validated live secondmate home.
#          SECONDMATE_SYNC lines report actionable skipped placement-specific
#          syncs or inheritance failures for live secondmate homes, plus
#          quarantine diagnostics for divergent shared captain-preference
#          copies; no-op/current and successful updates stay quiet.
#          SECONDMATE_LIVENESS lines report only actionable failures from the
#          recovery-grade state owned by bin/fm-backend.sh's
#          fm_backend_agent_state: skipped distinguishes an existing ambiguous
#          process, an unreadable target, and an unverified backend; respawn
#          failed names whether the endpoint was missing or agent-less.
#          Already-live and successfully relaunched secondmates are silent
#          unless FM_BOOTSTRAP_VERBOSE_FACTS=1 requests BOOTSTRAP_INFO facts.
#          A TANGLE line means the firstmate primary checkout (FM_ROOT) is stranded
#          on a feature branch instead of its default branch - a crewmate's work
#          landed in the primary instead of its own worktree; restore it per the line.
#          A MAIN_DIVERGED line means the firstmate primary checkout's local default
#          branch carries commits origin/<default> does not - typically a shared fix
#          landed directly on it instead of through the normal PR path - so the
#          fast-forward-only self-update path (/updatefirstmate) can no longer
#          reconcile it and declines to advance it, which is reported only to
#          whoever runs that update; reconcile manually per the line. Like TANGLE
#          it is scoped to the primary checkout by branch state, so detached-HEAD
#          worktrees and secondmate homes never trip it even though they read the
#          same shared refs, and a tangled primary defers to TANGLE.
#          The check function itself never fetches (it reads the already-known
#          origin/<default> ref) and stays silent for a missing origin, a missing
#          origin/<default> ref, or a local default branch that is merely behind
#          origin, so a local-only or offline install never false-alarms. The
#          non-detect-only line's remediation does instruct a `git fetch origin`
#          refresh, so - like TANGLE's own repair command - a detect-only,
#          lock-refused session gets advisory-only wording with no such command
#          instead, leaving refresh and reconciliation to the session holding the
#          fleet lock.
#          The primary checkout itself is fast-forwarded here the same way
#          /updatefirstmate does (bin/fm-update.sh's same ff_target call), so a
#          firstmate PR merged on origin reaches this home - and anything it
#          locally serves, such as a Mission Control board - without waiting for
#          the captain to run that update by hand. It runs first among the
#          mutating sweeps below so a live secondmate's own local-HEAD
#          fast-forward (secondmate_sync) already sees the newly-advanced primary
#          commit in the same pass; secondmate homes are never touched here
#          directly - the same .fm-secondmate-home marker check
#          startup_memory_budget_setup already uses keeps a secondmate home,
#          including a standalone clone that is not detached and does have an
#          origin remote, out of this step entirely. A clean, fast-forwardable
#          primary checkout advances
#          silently unless its instruction surface (AGENTS.md, bin/, or
#          .agents/skills/) changed, in which case a SELF_UPDATE line asks the
#          running agent to re-read AGENTS.md. A dirty or diverged checkout is
#          left untouched - never forced, stashed, or reset - and reports
#          SELF_UPDATE_BLOCKED so the captain is not left guessing why a merged
#          PR never showed up locally. This mutating step never runs in
#          detect-only mode, since it fetches. This cadence trigger runs on
#          every session start, so a merge landing between sessions is always
#          caught; bin/fm-pr-merge.sh separately calls the identical
#          primary_self_update() once, immediately, right after it confirms a
#          merge is this repo's own, so a merge landing mid-session (with
#          nothing prompting a fresh session start) is not left stale until
#          the next one - see bin/fm-ff-lib.sh's primary_self_update header
#          for the full mechanism shared by both trigger points.
#          treehouse is also MISSING when its installed version lacks
#          "treehouse get --lease" support.
#          no-mistakes is also MISSING when its installed version is older than
#          1.31.2.
#          The AXI-family floor policy is owned beside GH_AXI_MIN and
#          LAVISH_AXI_MIN below; the per-tool owners point there. An installed
#          build below its floor reports MISSING like no-mistakes, so the operator
#          is asked to upgrade rather than silently running an older tool.
#          tasks-axi feature probes remain a separate defense-in-depth check.
#          tasks-axi and quota-axi are required bootstrap tools (same class as
#          lavish-axi). A compatible tasks-axi default backend is silent.
#          quota-axi is required for the agent-owned dispatch-profile array
#          procedure in AGENTS.md section 4 and
#          .agents/skills/quota-array-dispatch/SKILL.md.
#          On a primary home, the locked mutable path materializes the visible
#          default config/startup-memory-budget=7500 when absent. It never
#          guesses at malformed or unsafe existing files, and secondmate homes
#          await the primary-authoritative inherited value instead of creating
#          their own.
#          X mode is OPTIONAL and inert unless FM_HOME/.env has a non-empty
#          FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN. When opted in, bootstrap requires curl+jq, writes
#          the relay poll shim and 30s cadence config, and prints an FMX line.
#          Fleet sync fetches, fast-forwards safe default-branch states, reports
#          recovered and STUCK clone drift, and prunes gone local branches; it is
#          bounded by FM_FLEET_SYNC_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT when it is a non-empty
#          numeric override, while non-numeric values fall back to 20s.
#          When the override is unset or blank, the timeout is
#          max(20, 5 + 3 * origin-backed project clone count). A timed-out
#          refresh relays any completed fm-fleet-sync.sh output before the
#          aggregate timeout skip line with timeout and elapsed seconds.
#          Set FM_FLEET_PRUNE=0 to skip branch pruning during that refresh.
#          A regular non-symlinked config/mission-control-board file optionally
#          enables a read-only stale-board check. Its one line is either an
#          absolute regular-file path or an http://127.0.0.1 URL (with an
#          optional port). File reads and loopback GETs are capped at 8 MiB, and
#          GETs have a two-second bound with proxies disabled. The board must
#          contain its rendered ISO-8601 UTC footer timestamp. Missing,
#          unreadable, malformed, future, or otherwise unprovable targets stay
#          silent. FM_MISSION_CONTROL_STALE_SECS overrides the 300-second
#          threshold only with a positive decimal integer.
#          Set FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 to skip the six MUTATING sweeps
#          (PR-check migration, secondmate_sync, secondmate_liveness_sweep,
#          secondmate_handoff_resume, x_mode_setup, fleet_sync) while still
#          printing every read-only detect line
#          above; the TANGLE line switches to advisory-only wording with no
#          checkout command. Used by
#          fm-session-start.sh's read-only path when another live session holds
#          the fleet lock, so a second concurrent session never race-mutates
#          PR-check artifacts, secondmate homes, pending handoff outboxes,
#          X-mode artifacts, project clones, or repair instructions.
#          Unset/0 (the default) runs every sweep exactly as before - this flag
#          is purely additive.
#        fm-bootstrap.sh install <tool>...
#          Install the named tools (only ones the captain approved).

# X mode (opt-in): when this home's .env carries a non-empty FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN,
# wire the relay poll into the existing authenticated watcher dispatch.
# Drops two idempotent, gitignored artifacts:
#   state/x-watch.check.sh - byte-static identity shim; the watcher validates
#                            its bytes and invokes bin/fm-x-poll.sh directly
#   config/x-mode.env      - exports FM_CHECK_INTERVAL=30, sourced by the watcher
#                            arm so only an X instance polls at the 30s cadence
# On opt-out (no token, or empty) it removes any such artifacts so the instance
# reverts to the default 300s no-poll behavior. Absent a token AND with no leftover
# artifacts it is a complete no-op (nothing written, nothing printed), so a non-X
# user sees zero change. Prints one confirmation line on opt-in, and one on opt-out
# only when it actually removed artifacts. It never touches the watcher itself;
# applying a cadence transition to a running watcher is the caller's job via
# the emitted harness-aware supervision repair instruction.
