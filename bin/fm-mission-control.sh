#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-mission-control.sh - render the mission control board as self-contained HTML.
#
# The board is READ-ONLY: it renders live fleet state and writes one HTML file.
# It acquires no lock, drains no wakes, arms no watcher, and mutates no fleet
# state. It reads git metadata from the project clones, which never writes, and
# the only file it writes is its own output.
#
# This command does not parse fleet state itself. Like bin/fm-fleet-view.sh it
# shells out to bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json once and renders that stable
# contract, so current_state, backlog roles, captain actionability, and
# secondmate current state keep exactly one owner. Three concerns come from
# outside the snapshot because the snapshot does not own them: data/projects.md
# is the delivery-posture registry; `quota-axi --tui --once` owns the allowance
# snapshot; each project card's last-change time comes from that project's own
# clone or, for a second mate, from when it last reported; and the narrow,
# forward-only autonomous-actions record supplies the recent action feed.
#
# The board never invents a completion percentage or an ETA. Progress judgement
# belongs to firstmate, so each project card states only what live state can
# prove: what is under way, what waits on the captain, and when it last changed.
#
# A card lists its in-progress work item by item - what each one is, how far it
# has travelled, and the model doing it - because a bare count tells the captain
# something is happening without telling them what. "How far" is the snapshot's
# derived lifecycle stage, drawn as five discrete rungs and always labelled with
# the stage name, so it reads as "this has reached Validating" and never as a
# fraction of the work done. The stage itself is never re-derived here; the
# snapshot owns it, as it owns every other piece of fleet state on this page.
# Setup uses the neutral slate quiet tone because endpoint presence does not prove
# movement; observed work alone uses the green live tone.
# The first six items stay open at a glance and every additional received item
# remains available in the same expandable shelf idiom as Deferred. Rows omitted
# upstream remain disclosed separately and are never presented as shelf contents.
# Only the Deferred shelf persists its open state; project overflow shelves do not
# read or write that preference.
#
# A captain decision the captain has consciously set aside leaves "Awaiting your
# decision" and its count, and appears in the quiet, closed-by-default Deferred
# shelf below it. Deferring is not a board action; see "Deferring a decision"
# below for the two commands that set one aside and bring it back.
#
# Paths resolve from the ACTIVE home: the snapshot's own roots.state,
# roots.data, and roots.projects are used verbatim, so FM_HOME and the
# FM_*_OVERRIDE variables are honoured without a second resolution here.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-mission-control.sh                  write <state>/mission-control.html
#   fm-mission-control.sh --out <path>     write to an explicit path
#   fm-mission-control.sh --stdout         print the HTML instead of writing
#   fm-mission-control.sh --no-quota       skip local allowance reads
#   fm-mission-control.sh --refresh <sec>  self-reload interval (default 60)
#   fm-mission-control.sh --controls       add the captain reply layer
#   fm-mission-control.sh --snapshot <f>   render a captured snapshot JSON file
#   fm-mission-control.sh -h|--help        usage
#
# Environment:
#   FM_MISSION_CONTROL_NOW_EPOCH  fix "now" for deterministic rendering.
#   FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE            config directory used for dispatch rendering;
#                                 otherwise the snapshot data root's sibling.
#
# Deferring a decision:
#   Firstmate sets a captain decision aside on the captain's word, in the home
#   whose backlog holds it, by changing that item's HOLD KIND alone - from
#   captain to tasks-axi's existing "parked" - and reverses it by restoring
#   captain. The hold kind, not the item's own kind, marks it as a captain
#   decision, so this preserves ship, scout, and standalone captain work alike.
#
#     set aside:   tasks-axi hold <id> --reason "<reason>" --kind parked
#     bring back:  tasks-axi hold <id> --reason "<reason>" --kind captain
#
#   tasks-axi requires --reason on every hold and stores the reason it is given,
#   so read the current reason from the owning home's backlog row and pass that
#   exact stored text back unchanged. For a second mate decision, the owning
#   home is that second mate's own home, not the main home or the board. The
#   reason shown on the board identifies the decision but may be shortened, so
#   it is not safe to copy. A different string silently rewrites the captain's
#   decision text.
#
# Reply controls (--controls):
#   The render stays read-only. --controls adds a reply layer whose every control
#   does exactly one thing: record ONE request that wakes firstmate. It performs no
#   action, reaches no external host, and carries no authority; firstmate
#   adjudicates each request under its own contract, exactly as if the captain had
#   said the same words in chat. The surface is reachable by anything that can
#   reach the service serving it, so reachability is never authorization.
#
#   A request travels to THIS DOCUMENT'S OWN URL, so the board needs no endpoint
#   and no knowledge of how it is served or proxied. bin/fm-procevent-board-reply.sh
#   owns that service, arming the wake, and normalizing what comes back. The legacy
#   Lavish bridge remains supported for the shared captain-request vocabulary but
#   gains no new transport behavior; see docs/mission-control.md for both and for
#   their limits.
#
#   The layer is hidden by CSS and revealed only after a script PROVES a transport
#   that can reach firstmate, so the same file served statically or opened from
#   disk is the read-only board it is without this flag, and no viewer is ever
#   shown a dead control. An acknowledged control is then replaced in place by a
#   full-width confirmation banner claiming only what the transport proved.
#   A regeneration reads this physical board's direct-service request log, so a
#   recorded Answer remains visible and sorts below unanswered decisions across
#   devices while browser storage bridges the interval before regeneration.
#   With script available, session-scoped presentation memory preserves the
#   active tab and stable reading position across both managed reloads and full
#   document replacement after an external output-file rewrite. --controls also
#   saves every open composer and unsent draft under its exact control identity,
#   and holds the managed timer while a control is open. The no-script fallback
#   keeps the same cadence with a meta refresh and remains the read-only board.
#
#   Each request is one line: FM-BOARD-REQUEST followed by one JSON object.
#
# Exit codes: 0 rendered, 1 runtime failure, 2 usage error.
#
# Output is written through a temporary file and renamed into place, so a
# browser refreshing on its own cadence never reads a half-written board.

#     model and not for who serves it (openai-codex/gpt-5.6-terra);
#   - a tagged local model keeps its exact tag, which is how it is addressed and
#     the only form its operator would recognise (ollama/qwen3.6:35b-fm);
#   - otherwise a vendor token and a trailing release stamp are dropped, a split
#     version is rejoined, and the remaining words are capitalised, so
#     claude-opus-5 reads Opus 5 and claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 reads Haiku 4.5.
# Nothing is invented: a model the rules do not recognise keeps its recorded
# words, so an unfamiliar model stays identifiable rather than being guessed at.

# One in-progress item: its name, its position on the delivery ladder, and the
# model doing it.
#
# The ladder is drawn as five discrete rungs rather than a smooth fill because
# discrete rungs are exactly what live state can prove. There is no per-file or
# percentage signal behind any of this, and a segmented bar promises none: it
# says "this has reached Validating", not "this is 65% done". The stage label
# beside it carries the meaning and the rungs are only the glance, so the bar is
# never the sole claim. Colour states how the item is MOVING, which is a
# different question from how far it has come: an item stopped at rung four is
# still stopped.
# A stage on a routed task crosses a home boundary - for a remote second mate,
# a host boundary - and the summary validator type-checks the surfaces it carries
# rather than the fields inside each row. So every number here is bounded before
# it is drawn, and an unrecognised motion falls back to unknown rather than
# reaching the page as a class with no colour rule behind it. The failure that
# would cause is the exact one this ladder exists to prevent: rungs rendering
# unfilled while the label beside them still claims a rung was reached.
