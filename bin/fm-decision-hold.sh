# fm-decision-hold.sh - deterministic mechanics for durable captain decisions.
#
# The semantic policy is owned once by
# .agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md. This script never reads report,
# visual-review, chat, or terminal prose to guess whether a decision exists.
# The invoking agent inventories unresolved decisions, assigns stable keys, and
# routes dependent work. This script supplies deterministic identities, creates
# and verifies structured tasks-axi captain holds, records completion attestation
# in the originating task's metadata, and closes a hold only after a durable
# decision record has been linked to existing dependent work.
#
# A hold identity is <origin-id>-decision-<decision-key>. Origin ids and decision
# keys must already be privacy-safe slugs. Repeating `hold` with the same identity
# is idempotent. A different decision key creates a different backlog identity.
# All backlog mutations run in the active FM_HOME, which keeps main-home and
# secondmate-home ownership aligned with the work that discovered the decision.
#
# Every captain decision filed here carries its context as SEPARATE structured
# body fields rather than one free-text reason, so no dimension can be skipped
# inside a blob: an optional exact question, an optional set of two to four short
# answer labels, an optional `fact` intake kind carrying its expected-answer hint,
# an optional shared-group slug, a required "Why now", "What it affects", and
# "Recommendation", and a required
# conscious choice between a private decision-aid URL and an explicit "no built
# surface applies" acknowledgment. Each is required only when the item does not
# already record it, so a first filing can never omit one while an idempotent retry
# never has to retype what is already stored. Repeating --option supplies the
# complete ordered set: two to four distinct labels of at most 80 bytes each.
# --kind accepts only `fact`; --expects describes the expected free-text shape,
# is valid only for that kind, and is REQUIRED once that kind is set, because a
# fact request the captain cannot answer in the expected shape is not answerable.
# --group accepts one privacy-safe slug of at most 80
# bytes and marks decisions that share one origin without changing their separate
# identities. Supplying an optional field later replaces that
# stored field, while omitting its flag preserves it. This script
# judges only that each dimension was addressed. Whether the prose is genuinely
# clear and jargon-free is a semantic
# judgement no script can make; the skill owns it, and data/captain-shared.md's
# decision-presentation bar is what it is judged against.
# `link` is the supported backfill for an existing hold; it accepts HTTPS only,
# preserves the rest of the body, and never fetches or rewrites the URL. It also
# clears a recorded "no built surface" claim, because a decision that has gained a
# built surface must stop saying it has none.
#
# Those per-flag rules are the filing bar. On top of them, one STRUCTURAL
# readiness checklist decides whether a filed decision is answerable at all, and
# bin/fm-decision-readiness.jq owns it so this script, `doctor`, and the board
# apply exactly the same rule. A decision carrying structured context is ready
# when it records a question and a recommendation, makes exactly one surface
# choice, keeps any option set to two to four distinct short labels, and pairs a
# `fact` kind with an expected-answer hint. Both filing paths refuse an
# incomplete filing, reporting every gap at once. A hold carrying only a
# free-text reason predates structured context and is deliberately outside the
# checklist, so it is never reported as incomplete. The checklist judges presence
# and shape only; whether the question is clear or the recommendation sound stays
# the semantic judgement above.
#
# `doctor` is the read-only sweep of that checklist. With no argument it checks
# every open captain decision in the active home, meaning an item that is not
# done and carries an active captain hold; a parked decision stays out of scope
# because the captain set it aside. With a task id it checks that one item. It
# names the specific failed check and the flag that fixes it, and exits non-zero
# when anything is incomplete. Nobody has to remember to run it: the same
# checklist reaches bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh and surfaces on the board's fleet
# health section, which docs/mission-control.md owns.

#
# `hold-item` applies that same bar to a backlog item that ALREADY EXISTS, whatever
# its own kind. It is the supported replacement for a bare
# `tasks-axi hold <id> --kind captain`, so a captain decision meets one bar
# whichever path filed it. It never creates the item and never changes its title,
# kind, or repo, and it never touches the decision_keys inventory that `complete`,
# `verify`, and scout teardown read: it records context and activates the captain
# hold, nothing else. It requires a QUEUED item, because a captain hold on an
# in-flight row leaves that row in flight, where it reads as work under way rather
# than as a decision waiting on the captain. Gate work already under way with
# `hold` under its own decision identity instead.
#
# Two captain-hold operations stay deliberately outside this bar because they
# restore text that already exists rather than file a decision: setting a decision
# aside under tasks-axi's "parked" hold kind, and bringing it back by restoring
# hold kind captain. bin/fm-mission-control.sh owns both, including the hazard that
# a different --reason silently rewrites the captain's own stored text.
#
# `complete` is the shared investigation and visual-review completion gate.
# `--none` is an explicit semantic attestation that the just-reviewed surface has
# no unresolved captain decision. Later review passes may add keys; a live task's
# metadata inventory is unioned idempotently. A post-teardown visual review can
# complete against the surviving report and holds without recreating task state.
# `verify` is read-only and is called by scout teardown so teardown cannot erase a
# source before this gate has succeeded.
#
# A decision identity is looked up in the live backlog first and, only when it is
# absent there, in data/done-archive.md, where tasks-axi Done retention prunes older
# resolved records. That secondary lookup is read-only and never restores a record.
# It satisfies the gate only for an archived record that is marked done, is kind
# captain, and still carries the durable resolution record. An identity absent from
# both sources, an archived record that is not resolved, and a missing, unreadable,
# or malformed archive all keep today's refusal, and the refusal now names what it
# actually found rather than reporting every case as absence.
#
# `retract` is the supported way to take a decision key back out of the recorded
# inventory when a later review pass establishes that it duplicates a decision
# already inventoried under a different key. Removing the duplicate backlog item
# with `tasks-axi rm` alone leaves the key in the recorded union and absent from
# both durability sources, which makes `verify` and `complete` refuse forever and
# strands scout teardown. `--superseded-by` is required and names the surviving
# key, which must already be in this origin's inventory and must itself pass the
# same durability check. That anchor is what keeps the gate intact: the question
# stays gated, only its duplicate identity goes away, and the union can never be
# emptied by a retraction. A key that is no longer in the recorded inventory takes
# a no-op path that does not inspect or mutate the retracted identity. Otherwise
# the retracted identity is removed from the backlog when it is still there, so
# `tasks-axi rm`'s own refusal to delete an id that active work still blocks on
# continues to apply. A decision that already carries a recorded captain answer
# is never retractable, whether it is durably resolved or still queued because
# `resolve` was interrupted after writing that answer. Deleting it would lose both
# the answer and the retry identity. Retraction is idempotent, so an interrupted
# run is repaired by running the same command again.
#
# `resolve` requires every --routed-to task to exist and to be blocked by the hold.
# It writes the captain decision and routed identities into the hold body, clears
# those dependency edges, and only then marks the hold Done. A failure before the
# final step leaves the captain hold open.
