# fm-decision-hold.sh - deterministic mechanics for durable captain decisions.
#
# The semantic policy is owned once by
# .agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md. This script never reads report,
# visual-review, chat, or terminal prose to guess whether a decision exists.
# The invoking agent inventories unresolved decisions, assigns stable keys, and
# routes dependent work. This script supplies deterministic identities, creates
# and verifies structured tasks-axi captain holds, records completion attestation
# in the originating task's metadata, and closes a hold only after a durable
# decision record has been linked to existing dependent work.
#
# A hold identity is <origin-id>-decision-<decision-key>. Origin ids and decision
# keys must already be privacy-safe slugs. Repeating `hold` with the same identity
# is idempotent. A different decision key creates a different backlog identity.
# All backlog mutations run in the active FM_HOME, which keeps main-home and
# secondmate-home ownership aligned with the work that discovered the decision.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-decision-hold.sh id <origin-id> <decision-key>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh hold <origin-id> <decision-key> \
#     --title <title> --reason <reason> [--repo <repo>]
#   fm-decision-hold.sh complete <origin-id> (--none | <decision-key>...)
#   fm-decision-hold.sh verify <origin-id>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh retract <origin-id> <decision-key> --superseded-by <decision-key>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh resolve <origin-id> <decision-key> \
#     --decision-file <path> --routed-to <task-id> [--routed-to <task-id>...]
#
# `complete` is the shared investigation and visual-review completion gate.
# `--none` is an explicit semantic attestation that the just-reviewed surface has
# no unresolved captain decision. Later review passes may add keys; a live task's
# metadata inventory is unioned idempotently. A post-teardown visual review can
# complete against the surviving report and holds without recreating task state.
# `verify` is read-only and is called by scout teardown so teardown cannot erase a
# source before this gate has succeeded.
#
# A decision identity is looked up in the live backlog first and, only when it is
# absent there, in data/done-archive.md, where tasks-axi Done retention prunes older
# resolved records. That secondary lookup is read-only and never restores a record.
# It satisfies the gate only for an archived record that is marked done, is kind
# captain, and still carries the durable resolution record. An identity absent from
# both sources, an archived record that is not resolved, and a missing, unreadable,
# or malformed archive all keep today's refusal, and the refusal now names what it
# actually found rather than reporting every case as absence.
#
# `retract` is the supported way to take a decision key back out of the recorded
# inventory when a later review pass establishes that it duplicates a decision
# already inventoried under a different key. Removing the duplicate backlog item
# with `tasks-axi rm` alone leaves the key in the recorded union and absent from
# both durability sources, which makes `verify` and `complete` refuse forever and
# strands scout teardown. `--superseded-by` is required and names the surviving
# key, which must already be in this origin's inventory and must itself pass the
# same durability check. That anchor is what keeps the gate intact: the question
# stays gated, only its duplicate identity goes away, and the union can never be
# emptied by a retraction. The retracted identity is removed from the backlog when
# it is still there, so `tasks-axi rm`'s own refusal to delete an id that active
# work still blocks on continues to apply. A durably resolved decision is never
# retractable, because it already satisfies the gate. Retraction is idempotent, so
# an interrupted run is repaired by running the same command again.
#
# `resolve` requires every --routed-to task to exist and to be blocked by the hold.
# It writes the captain decision and routed identities into the hold body, clears
# those dependency edges, and only then marks the hold Done. A failure before the
# final step leaves the captain hold open.
