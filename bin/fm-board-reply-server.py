"""fm-board-reply-server.py - the mission control board's direct reply service.

Launch it through `bin/fm-procevent-board-reply.sh serve <board.html>`, which owns
identity derivation and passes every path here explicitly. Running this file by
hand is supported but the adapter is the interface.

Usage:
  fm-board-reply-server.py --board <board.html> --requests <log>
                           --replies <log>
                           --parser <fm-board-request-parse.pl>
                           --registration <procevent source record>
                           [--port <n>] [--host 127.0.0.1]
                           [--max-body <bytes>]

WHAT IT DOES, and nothing else. One loopback port:

  GET  any path                 the board file, read fresh from disk every time
  GET  ?fm-board-reply=probe    a small JSON presence answer for the board's own probe
  GET  ?fm-board-reply=thread   the Ask-firstmate conversation, for display
  POST any path                 validate one captain request and durably record it

The thread read is display only, in both directions. It merges the captain `ask`
requests already recorded here with the replies firstmate posted through
`bin/fm-procevent-board-reply.sh say`, and it is the ONLY thing that reads the
reply log. Nothing acts on a reply, nothing wakes from one, and no path here
lets a reply reach the request log: the two logs are separate files and only the
request log is what the wake source reads.

Recording a request is not the same as firstmate collecting it, so both answers
report `armed`: whether a wake is registered for this board right now. The board
uses it to keep its confirmation truthful, and startup prints it so a service
launched against the wrong FM_HOME says so instead of quietly accepting requests
nothing will ever read.

AUTHORITY: none. A POST here performs nothing. It appends one line to a private
append-only log and returns; firstmate later reads that line as captain INTENT and
adjudicates it under its own contract, exactly as if the captain had said the same
words in chat. Nothing here merges, answers, defers, or touches fleet state, and
reaching this port is never authorization for any of that.

Binding. Loopback only, and a non-loopback --host is refused rather than bound.
Tailnet reachability is provided by reverse-proxying this port, which is the
project's existing trust boundary for every captain-facing local surface; see
docs/mission-control.md "The board reply service".

Same-site only, without a token layer. A loopback port is reachable by any page
the captain has open in the same browser, so a cross-site POST is refused three
independent ways: `Content-Type: application/json` and the required
`X-Fm-Board-Reply` header are both outside what a cross-origin request may send
without a preflight, no OPTIONS preflight is ever granted, and a browser-asserted
`Sec-Fetch-Site` that is present and not `same-origin` is rejected outright.
`Access-Control-Allow-*` is never sent on any response.

Validation is not implemented here. Every admitted request is validated by
bin/fm-board-request-parse.pl, over the exact record line this server is about to
store, so the rules that admit a request at the door and the rules that read it at
wake time are one implementation and cannot drift.

Path-agnostic on purpose: a reverse proxy may or may not strip its mount prefix,
so every GET that is not a `fm-board-reply` query serves the board and a POST is
accepted on any path. The board therefore posts to its own URL and needs no path
convention.

Every answer here, the thread included, is protected by exactly what protects the
board page itself: this port serves the board to any GET, no `Access-Control-
Allow-*` is ever sent, so another origin can issue a read but can never see the
answer. The thread adds no kind of exposure the board file did not already have.

Exit codes: 0 clean shutdown, 1 startup or runtime failure, 2 usage error.
