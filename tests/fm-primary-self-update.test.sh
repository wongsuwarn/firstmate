# Behavior tests for fm-bootstrap.sh's automatic primary-checkout self-update.
#
# Firstmate's board and other locally-served surfaces are regenerated from
# the primary firstmate home. Before this guard, a merged firstmate PR only
# reached that home when the captain remembered to run /updatefirstmate by
# hand, so a merged re-skin (or any other change) could keep being served
# stale indefinitely with no signal. bin/fm-bootstrap.sh's primary_self_update
# now attempts the exact same fast-forward /updatefirstmate performs
# (bin/fm-ff-lib.sh's ff_target, base_mode "origin") on every non-detect-only
# bootstrap run, and reports a durable, captain-visible SELF_UPDATE_BLOCKED
# line rather than silently declining when the checkout cannot be advanced -
# never forcing, stashing, or resetting. These cases pin: a clean checkout
# fast-forwards; an instruction-surface change asks the agent to re-read
# AGENTS.md; a dirty or diverged checkout is left untouched and reported; a
# secondmate-shaped detached HEAD, and a standalone-clone secondmate marked
# with .fm-secondmate-home, are both silently left to their own existing
# convergence paths; and detect-only mode never fetches or mutates. All
# hermetic over temporary git repos.
