#
# On some tmux/WSL setups a brand-new window's pane_current_path transiently
# reports a stale, unrelated-but-real path on the very first poll, before the
# pane actually settles into the worktree treehouse get moved it to. That stale
# path still passes the loop's "differs from the project" check and
# validate_spawn_worktree's "is a real, distinct worktree" check (it IS a real
# git checkout, just the wrong one), so a naive single-read loop silently
# records the wrong worktree= in state/<id>.meta. This test simulates that
# transient-then-settled pane_current_path sequence with a fake tmux and
# asserts the recorded worktree resolves to the real, settled worktree, never
# the stale first read.
