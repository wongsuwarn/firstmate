# Behavior tests for the primary-checkout origin-divergence guard.
#
# Firstmate's self-update path (/updatefirstmate, bin/fm-update.sh) is
# fast-forward ONLY: it advances the primary checkout's local default branch to
# origin/<default> and silently skips the moment the local branch is not an
# ancestor of origin. The failure mode this guard surfaces is a shared fix
# landing directly on the local default branch instead of through the normal PR
# path, which diverges it from origin and leaves every later self-update quietly
# doing nothing with no alarm. These cases pin: the shared lib's divergence
# classification (healthy/behind, diverged, ahead-only, no origin, no
# origin/<default> ref), its primary-only scoping over the shared refs every
# linked worktree can also read, and the fm-bootstrap.sh MAIN_DIVERGED problem
# line - all hermetic over temp git repos.
