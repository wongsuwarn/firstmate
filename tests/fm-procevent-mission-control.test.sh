# Behavior tests for the mission control process-event adapter.

# The subject is the request NORMALIZER, exercised only through the adapter's
# public `requests` command. Its whole job is to decide what a captured Lavish
# result means, and every case here is a way of getting that wrong: a forged
# envelope, a note that tries to become a field, a truncated capture, a field
# that means nothing for its intent. Each must reach "unrecognized" rather than
# a plausible-looking request, because the records this prints are what
# firstmate reads as captain intent.
#
# The wire format is a vendor-rendered surface, so the first case pins it
# against BYTES CAPTURED FROM A REAL SEND through lavish-axi 0.1.45 - a real
# board control, in a real browser, through a real Lavish session. A test that
# only fed this parser its own idea of the format could not tell the difference
# between reading Lavish correctly and reading its own assumption.
