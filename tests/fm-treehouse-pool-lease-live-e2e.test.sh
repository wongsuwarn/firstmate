# tests/fm-treehouse-pool-lease-live-e2e.test.sh - opt-in drift guard proving the
# INSTALLED treehouse still honours the pool contract fm-spawn.sh depends on.
#
# Why this file exists: firstmate leases each task's pooled copy itself
# (`treehouse get --lease --lease-holder <id>`) so the reservation outlives the
# pane's shell and holds across homes. Four properties of that contract are
# emitted by the vendor, not by firstmate, and a release could change any of them
# without notice:
#
#   1. `get --lease` prints ONLY the worktree path on stdout, so the path can be
#      read without parsing banners.
#   2. A leased copy is never handed out by a later `get`, even with no process
#      running inside it - the whole point, because a pane's shell dying is
#      exactly what used to free a copy a live task still owned.
#   3. `return` WITHOUT --force refuses a copy that still holds uncommitted work
#      rather than cleaning it, which is what keeps an abandoned copy's unlanded
#      work safe when firstmate declines to reclaim it.
#   4. `return --force` releases a LEASED copy back to the pool. Under a lease
#      that call is now the only thing that ever frees a slot, so a release that
#      quietly ignored it would fill the pool over a long run instead of racing
#      over one copy - a different failure, equally fatal.
#
# The portable counterpart in tests/fm-spawn-worktree-settle.test.sh pins
# firstmate's own behaviour on top of these, and runs in CI against whatever
# treehouse is installed. This guard reads the vendor contract directly and fails
# naming the tool and version. Run it after any treehouse upgrade and before
# trusting refreshed evidence in docs/verification/runtime-backends.md.
#
# It consumes no model tokens and never touches a pool outside its own fixture:
# the fixture repo pins `root` to a temporary directory, so every worktree and
# all pool state live and die inside that directory.
